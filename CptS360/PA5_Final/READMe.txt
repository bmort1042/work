Professor,

Due to the firewall issues with elec, I was unable to test from one ip to another.
I did test the fact that the program accepted elecs ip, and then found the list,
but I had to be running both ./tattled and ./rtattle in elec. 

It was working locally, and this was the case with my lab 12, so I am making the assumption
this will work too. I just didn't have enough time to figure out where else to test it at.

Thanks.
